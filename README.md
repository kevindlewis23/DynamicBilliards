# DynamicBilliards
Simulation of outer billiards with optional starting angle


# C++ version
This version is not only much faster, but also a good deal more accurate.  
You need SFML installed and in the path (if you get weird errors, you probably forgot this)  


# To run
You need python3 installed  
Install pygame with `pip install pygame`
Run with `python3 main.py`

# Initial conditions
You can change the shape and the starting angle as well as some other simluation parameters in the section labeled with INITIAL CONDITIONS in `main.py`
